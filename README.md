# ETL_project


We will be taking our data from fbref.com which is a website that has different datasets on Soccer teams in several different leagues. Our team has decided to focus on the La Liga league. We pulled the data from the 2020-2021 season from the Player Standards Stats table and joined it on the League Table on the column Squad. We will perform some transformations on the tables and migrate it to a single relational database in POSTGRES.

Our data sources are going to come from the following seasons:

• 2020-2021 - https://fbref.com/en/comps/12/10731/2020-2021-La-Liga-Stats
